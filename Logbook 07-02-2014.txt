After 3 days of trying to get the ethernet shield to connect to the Node.js server I have given up.

Steps taken:
1. Implement HTTP server
2. Implement UDP server
3. Implement TCP server
4. Implement raw socket server

No connection ever established.

Workaround - Build C# client to read serial ports of arduino and forward data to Node.js server.
